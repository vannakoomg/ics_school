Hey there.

The fedora debugging box is up and running.
You can 'ssh' into by running:
    docker exec -it imagick_fedora_1 bash

In a separate cli window.
Or if you checked imagick out into a different directory, then find the box name with `docker ps`

Once inside if you run
    sh docker/fedora/compileImagick.sh

Imagick should get compiled, and then you can run:
    sh docker/fedora/runGdb.sh

to see if fail, eventually.
